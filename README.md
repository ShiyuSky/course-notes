# Course Notes

Neural Networks and Deep Learning (taught by Andrew Ng)
1. cat_recognition: A simple Neural Network model using logistic regression to recognize cat images
2. planar_data_classification: A one-hidden-layer Neural Network model for learning the leaf patterns of the flower
3. building_neural_network_step_by_step: Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network
4. cat_recognition_deep: A deep Neural Network model using linear function and ReLU/sigmoid activation functions to recognize cat images
